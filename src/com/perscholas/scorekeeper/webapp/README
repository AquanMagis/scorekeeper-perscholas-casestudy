This is a very, very rough draft of the website for my Scorekeeper case study.

The current iteration includes login, registration, and welcome page prototypes, as well as a credits page for sourced resources.
On the login page:
    username: test
    password: test
will validate to reach the welcome page.

Completing the registration page will also lead to the welcome page.
    Usernames must contain only alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores.
    Both password and confirm password boxes must contain the same password. Passwords can take any character.
    Emails only use default validation that comes with email input type.
    All values under the optional section are optional. All others are required.

Game creation screen can be accessed from the welcome menu.
    Sliding carousel will change to the appropriate values for each rule set.
